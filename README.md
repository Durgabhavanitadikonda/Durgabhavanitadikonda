- ⚡ Fun fact: The game of chess, as we know it today, is believed to have originated in India around the 6th century AD.
              Originally called "chaturanga," the game was played with pieces representing different elements of an Indian army: infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots.
              As the game spread to Persia, it evolved into "shatranj" before reaching Europe and becoming the chess game we are familiar with today.
